		<h2>How to Use Enumerable#Cycle</h2>

			Although Enumerables may seem to be confusing or intimidating, there are actually not so tough. If you understand how loops, arrays and hashes operate, then Enumerables are just extra tools that can make huge differences in less lines of code. One method to work with Enumerables is #cycle. It is very simple to understand how this method works - just take a look:
		</p>
		<p>
		<pre><code>
		days_of_week = [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday]
		array.cycle { |day| print day }
		=>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, #forever
		</code></pre>
			As you can see from the code above, the array will repeat itself over and over again as an infinite loop. A cycle method will select each element of the enumerable and repeat each element n times or forever if n is not defined or given. As programmers, we usually never want to have an infinite loop, therefore, our code would look more like this:

		<pre><code>
		array = [Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday]
		array.cycle(2) { |day| print day}
		=> Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
		</code></pre>
			Obviously, this is a very basic example of how to use the cycle method within an array. The real power can come when combining this method with other enumerable functions like <code>.next</code> and <code>.rewind</code>.
		</p>
		<h3><code>next</code> & <code>rewind</code></h3>
	    <p>
	    	We can use <code>next</code> and <code>rewind</code> to give us the next item in a repeating sequence.
	   	<pre><code>
	    	days = days_of_the_week.cycle
	    	days.next
	    	=>Monday
	    	days.next
	    	=>Tuesday
	    	days.next
	    	=>Wednesday
	    </code></pre>
	    <pre><code>
	    	days.rewind
	   	=>Monday
	    </code></pre>
	    	Here we see the rewind method resetting the enumerable back to the first item in the sequence.
	    </p>
	    <h3>A Step Further</h3>
	    <p>
		  	Let's say we have another array called <code>roommates</code> and we set it equal to everyone who lives in an apartment. 
		<pre><code>
		roommates_living_with = [John, Joe, Jay, James]
		roommates = roommates_living_with.cycle
		</code></pre>
		 	Let's also call the cycle method to the array and see how we can use this with <code>days_of_week</code> to create a schedule of who is responsible for cooking each day. 
		<pre><code>
		10.times do
			day = days.next
	 		roommate = roommates.next
	 		puts "On #{day}, #{roommate} will be responsible for cooking!"
	 	end
	 	=>On Monday, John will be responsible for cooking!
	 	On Monday, Joe will be responsible for cooking!
		On Tuesday, Jay will be responsible for cooking!
	 	On Wednesday, James will be responsible for cooking!
	 	On Thursday, John will be responsible for cooking!
	 	On Friday, Joe will be responsible for cooking!
	 	On Saturday, Jay will be responsible for cooking!
	 	On Sunday, James will be responsible for cooking!
	 	On Monday, John will be responsible for cooking!
	 	On Tuesday, Joe will be responsible for cooking!
		</code></pre>
		</p>  
	    <p>
	    	You can see that cycle, although at first glance, looks like a irrelevant method that may lead to an infinite loop. However, it can be a very powerful tool used in combination with the <code>next</code> and <code>rewind</code> methods. As something so simple as days of the week and your roommates, you can easily create a schedule, not only for cooking, but for other chores as well.

	<p>Growing up, I wasn't one of those kids who knew exactly what he wanted to be (i.e. Astronaut, Police Office, Cowboy etc.), instead I focused on what I love doing which was playing football. It was until I built my first computer from scratch that I knew being in the IT Industry was where I belong. It was the ability to teach myself how to use & create technology that formed my path in life. Hence, I earned a Masters Degree from DeVry in MIS and currently work in the IT field for a Network Consultant.</p>
