			There is often a question of "when do I use classes vs. IDs when styling an HTML doc?" The answer is clear-cut - "is there more than one element which requires the same style, now or at any time in the future?, and if the answer is even 'maybe', then make it a class." However, before we get into the specifics of when, let's talk what.
		</p>
	    <p>
	    	Classes and IDs are types of selectors used in HTML/CSS formatting of a webpage. Best practices show that you use classes and IDs within the HTML document to categorize specific elements of your webpage and use CSS to style those elements a specific way. For example, 
	    	<pre><code>
	    	.cursive-heading {
				color: #DF7401;
				font-size: 45px;
				font-family: Cursive;
				text-align: center;
			}
			</code></pre>
			This is an example of a CSS format of a selector. Above, we have labeled multiple items in the <code>.cursive-heading</code> and are able to style them with the same properties. We are able to give multiple headings in our wedbpage the same properties without having to style each one separately.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	However, lets say within your webpage, you want one of your headings a little bit different. Instead of giving it the same class selector as <code>cursive-heading</code>, we can give it it's own ID selector <code>#different-heading</code> and give it style porperties different from the other headings. For example,
	    	<pre><code>
	    	#different-heading {
	    		color: black;
	    		cont-size: 25px;
	    		font-family: sans-serif;
	    		text-align: left;
	    	}
	    	</code></pre>
	    	Although this heading may have the same tag in the HTML document, it has a specific selector that allows the developer to style it differently within the CSS code. Notice how we distinguish classes(<code>.cursive-heading</code>) from IDs(<code>#different-heading</code>). All classes have a period (.) before the name of the class and all IDs have the pound (#) symbol before the name which tells the CSS document which is which. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	Going back to the rule of thumb - "is there more than one element which requires the same style, now or at any time in the future?, and if the answer is even 'maybe', then make it a class" - we now know when to use each selector. If there is the slightest possibility to use more than one element with the same style properties, a class is neeeded. If not, we should use an ID selector instead.

	<p>Growing up, I wasn't one of those kids who knew exactly what he wanted to be (i.e. Astronaut, Police Office, Cowboy etc.), instead I focused on what I love doing which was playing football. It was until I built my first computer from scratch that I knew being in the IT Industry was where I belong. It was the ability to teach myself how to use & create technology that formed my path in life. Hence, I earned a Masters Degree from DeVry in MIS and currently work in the IT field for a Network Consultant.</p>
