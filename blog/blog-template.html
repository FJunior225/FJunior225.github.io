<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair? It was different than my first pairing and we struggled to follow the direction clearly, my fault. I misread as a navigator and we started doing the HTML off our blog index wireframe and not an individual post.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process? Yes, I definitely think it helps, it gives me an understanding of how to format the HTML file.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? We included the title, name and date as a header with the content and image associated with the blog post in the body. We also included links to other pages of our website and our social media site in the footer.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? I did not learn anything new, however I did teach my pair how to use the <hr> tag to create a horizontal line to separate items.
