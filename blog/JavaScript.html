		<h1>Journey Through Dev Bootcamp</h1>
		<h2>Ruby Hash vs JavaScript Objects</h2>
		<h3>FJ Collins Jr. - February 14, 2016</h3>

		<p>This week, we journey into JavaScript after learning Ruby and its powerful built-in methods for the last four weeks. At first, I was a little nervous because this is my first experience with any type of programming language, therefore, I had no expectation of what lied ahead. Little did I know, there were many similarities between Ruby and JavaScipt(JS). One in particular was Ruby's Hashes compared to JS' Objects. Both are a collection of data that uses a key/value pairing system. However, after digging a little deeper, you can tell what separates the two.</p>
		<h3>Similarities</h3>
		<p>The first thing that stood out between Ruby hashes and JS objects were their syntax (how they looked):
		<pre><code>
		<!-- # Ruby Hash-->
		dog = {name: "Nico", age: 7, type: "Yorkshire Terrier"}

		<!-- // JS Object -->
		var dog = {name: "Nico", age: 7, type: "Yorkshire Terrier"};
		</code>
		</pre>
		At first glance, they look identical in syntax - the way their keys are established using symbols are the same. What about accessing those attributes?
		<pre><code>
		# Ruby Hash
		dog[:age]

		// JS Object
		dog.age;
		// or
		dog["age"]; // depending on how it was created
		</code></pre>
		Again, very similar with some minor syntax differences. As you can see, the storage of each "key" using symbols are identical. In Ruby, we reference them as keys, whereas in JS, we reference them as properties. However, calling on each does exactly the same thing, return the value. Another interesting concept is that the keys in Ruby can be different objects such as a string, number or a symbol, however, in JS, there is no specific label of a property - it is just a property. In the examples above, it is important to point out that I used symbols in both Ruby & JS.</p>
		<p>Now let's say we want to add more items to our collections of data - we can take it a step further and say, lets add an array to our collections of data...</p>
	    <pre><code>
	    # Ruby Hash
		dog[:color] = ["black", "gold", "white"]

		// JS Object
		dog.color = ["black", "gold", "white"];
	    </code></pre>
	 	<h3>Some Differences</h3>
	    <p>One huge difference is that an object in JS can take a function as a value. Now understanding the difference between Ruby methods and JS functions is another blog post within itself, however, Ruby methods are not objects and therefore, cannot be accepted as a value within a hash.
	    <pre><code>
		// JS Object
		dog.bark = function() {
			console.log("woof, woof!")
		}
		dog.bark()
		=> woof, woof!
	    </code></pre>
	    As you can see with JS, not only with objects, but throughout its programming language, there is a tremendous amount of flexibility and control by the developer. You can also do a lot more customization with JS. There are many other similarities and differences between the two languages and hashes vs. objects are only the beginning.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    I hope this gives you a better understanding of Ruby hashes and JS objects. Please come back soon!

	<p>Growing up, I wasn't one of those kids who knew exactly what he wanted to be (i.e. Astronaut, Police Office, Cowboy etc.), instead I focused on what I love doing which was playing football. It was until I built my first computer from scratch that I knew being in the IT Industry was where I belong. It was the ability to teach myself how to use & create technology that formed my path in life. Hence, I earned a Masters Degree from DeVry in MIS and currently work in the IT field for a Network Consultant.</p>
