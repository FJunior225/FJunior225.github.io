			Being new to not only the Tech Industry, but to the Programming Industry as well, there are a lot of things I do not know. One for which, is security. More specifically how developers follow best practices when it comes to securing their programs.
		</p>
		<h3>Where does insecurities come from?</h3>
	    <p>
	    	Plain and simple, bugs. Why do programs have bugs? We're all human and make mistakes, whether it be from ignorance, haste, carelessness or any other reason. No one is perfect, therefore, no code is necessarily perfect. These bugs can lead to unintentional flaws that allow someone to compromise your system and take advantage of those human errors. So what can we do to prevent this from happening?
	    </p>
	    <h3>Best-Practices for coding</h3>
	    <p>
		  	<ol>
		  		<li>Design your program before you code: It's better to have some sort of structure before you begin your code, so that changes made will affect little code. More changes could lead to more mistakes made, nonetheless, you should think about such things like the environment in which the program will run; input and output behavior; any files to be used; arguments recognized; or any other aspects of behavior. Realizing these behaviors can recognize future errors that may arise and a way to fix them.</li>
		  		<li>Make critical portion of your program as simple as possible: This will help to ensure that any debugging will not hinder your program functions. Simple coding will also lead to less errors and in turn, less bugs.</li>
		  		<li>Never trust just any input: This is important because untrusted sources can lead to damaging code. Make sure you're feedback is from people you trust or websites you trust.</li>
		  		<li>Resist the temptation to add a feature for the sole purpose that you can: This stems from keep your code simple - only add a feature when it is identified that it is needed.</li>
		  		<li>Lastly, keep it simple again!</li>
		  	</ol>
	    </p>  
	    <p>
	    	I note only wrote this post for others to gain knowledge of best-practices when it comes to securely code, but also for myself. It was an interesting topic to research and it reminded me that simple code is secure code. DBC is really doing a good job having us research concepts we enjoy and don't understand fully. I'm excited to see what comes up next!

	    <p>
	    	<a href="https://niccs.us-cert.gov/">The National Initiative for Cybersecurity Careers and Studies</a> has a <a href="https://niccs.us-cert.gov/education/cyber-games-and-programming">hands-on learning</a> page for those who would like to familiarize themselves with more information about security and its relation to programming. I thought they did an great job to use games as a method for teaching. Check it out!

	    	I hope you all enjoyed this post as it is one of many on my journey to become a software engineer. Please comment and ask any questions that arise - I will gladly respond. Thank you!

	<p>Growing up, I wasn't one of those kids who knew exactly what he wanted to be (i.e. Astronaut, Police Office, Cowboy etc.), instead I focused on what I love doing which was playing football. It was until I built my first computer from scratch that I knew being in the IT Industry was where I belong. It was the ability to teach myself how to use & create technology that formed my path in life. Hence, I earned a Masters Degree from DeVry in MIS and currently work in the IT field for a Network Consultant.</p>
