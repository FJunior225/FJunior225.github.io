		<p>In order to understand that benefits of Git, one must understand exactly what is version control. According to git-scm.com, version control "is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later." Therefore, if you are working on a project, either by yourself or collaborating with others, you can keep track of all the 'versions' of your project you create. Each change that is made, a record is created about that change and you are able to write a message about exactly the change you made and when it occurred. So, you're working on your project which is an elaborate presentation to the committee of your company and each slide you add creates a change to your presentation. Well, that change is recorded with a message to let you know what change occured, when, by whom and specifically shows what was added or removed. This can be hugely beneficial when projects take time, require collaboration, multiple changes occur frequently and require failsafes.</p>
	    <p>Lets say your project requires collaboration, you're both working on this presentation but version control is not available. Therefore, the project is stored on a shared folder and in order for you to work on it, you have to let your teammate know so that he does not try to access the file a and corrupt it. Therefore, you have to constantly be in communication (never a bad thing, but in this case inefficient) and while you are working he or she is not. With version control, both you and your teammate can work on the presentation simultaneously without fear of overwriting saves or corruption to the file or group of files. The way Git makes this happen is through a very unique encrypted algorithm called SHA-1, but importantly what this algorithm does is allow Git to determine if a file's name has been changed (daleV, 2011). Also, it allows users to easy copy and clone a project to a computer and still be exactly the same to the original.</p>
	    <p>Now since your project is extensive and requires multiple save/changes, it can be tedious without a version control system. According to git-tower.com, some questions are hard to answer without a VCS (Version Control System) such as: How much do you save? Only the save files or complete project? How do you name these versions? How do you know what's different in each version? All of these questions are equally important and very difficult to answer without a VCS. Your project can now be neatly managed with all previous versions precisely stored within the VCS (www.git-tower.com, 2013). If you need to go back on a specific version to undo a change, you won't have to undo everything you did passed that change, you just have to load the previous version before that change occurred. Using Git provides this stress-free environment when it comes to all of your projects.</p>
	    <p>With using Git, you are able to store your code on GitHub, which is a central location online for all your projects for everyone to see and collaborate with as well. GitHub provides a safe environment and protects your projects you upload to be yours and only yours. For example, GitHub's Terms of Service, Section F, 'we claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Service. Your profile and materials uploaded remain yours' (Orsini, 2013). Not only are your protected, but GitHub makes it easy to collaborate with others by forking and cloning a repository (directory). I can lookup whoever I wish, friend or coworker, view a specific repository, fork it to my profile, clone it to my local computer and start working on it. When I make changes, I can then submit a pull request to the original owner that may improve his or her project. GitHub provides a huge community of people looking to help each other!</p>  
	    <p>I hope you all enjoyed this post as it is the first of many on my journey to become a software engineer. Please comment and ask any questions that arise - I will gladly respond. Thank you!</p>

	<p>Growing up, I wasn't one of those kids who knew exactly what he wanted to be (i.e. Astronaut, Police Office, Cowboy etc.), instead I focused on what I love doing which was playing football. It was until I built my first computer from scratch that I knew being in the IT Industry was where I belong. It was the ability to teach myself how to use & create technology that formed my path in life. Hence, I earned a Masters Degree from DeVry in MIS and currently work in the IT field for a Network Consultant.</p>

<!--
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair? It was different than my first pairing and we struggled to follow the direction clearly, my fault. I misread as a navigator and we started doing the HTML off our blog index wireframe and not an individual post.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process? Yes, I definitely think it helps, it gives me an understanding of how to format the HTML file.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? We included the title, name and date as a header with the content and image associated with the blog post in the body. We also included links to other pages of our website and our social media site in the footer.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)? I did not learn anything new, however I did teach my pair how to use the <hr> tag to create a horizontal line to separate items.
