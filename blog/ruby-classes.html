		<h1>Journey Through Dev Bootcamp</h1>
		<h2>Who is a Class & What Does it do?(Arnold Voice)</h2>
		<h3>FJ Collins Jr. - February 7, 2016</h3>

		<p>
		So you have begun your own journey through Ruby and understand how almost everything in Ruby is an object - arrays, hashes, integers, strings etc. Each one of these elements have a separate class to associate them with. For example, an easy way to find out which object belongs to which class is to call class on that object...
		<pre><code>
			puts 1.class
			puts "".class
			puts [].class

			=>Fixnum
			=>String
			=>Array	
		</code>
		</pre>
		You can also ask whether a specific object is part of a particular class...
		<pre><code>
			puts 1.is_a?(Integer)
			puts 1.is_a?(Array)

			=> true
			=>false
		</code></pre>
		This is all well and good, but how can we manipulate classes to see how a real-life object works? What if we have an object like <code>computer</code> and we want to see its attributes, responsibilities, actions etc. We can create our own class called <code>Computer</code> and create different methods of objects to see its actions, color, size etc. 
		</p>
		<h3>Creating a Class for <code>Computer</code></h3>
	    <p>
	    Like methods, classes are defined with opening word <code>class</code> and is completed with an <code>end</code> statement.
	    <pre><code>
	    	class Computer
	    	end
	    </code></pre>
	    Next, we want to indicate which variables are going to be accessed throughout the class. A best-practice use would be to <code>Initialize</code> the variables for computers.
	    <pre><code>
	    	class Computer
	    		def Initialize(brand, model)
	    			@brand = brand
	    			@model = model_number
	    			@os = operating_system
	    			@users = users
	    		end
	    	end
	    </code></pre>
	    Here we have a couple of variables defined and you might have noticed the @ before each variable. These are known as instance variables and their scope are confined to whatever object self refers to. Therefore, although it is a variable, <code>@os</code> can be referenced throughout the class <code>Computer</code>.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    This concept of instantiation sounds intimidating, however it's really a not as bas as it seems. This just means that when Ruby uses the <code>Computer</code> class to create a new one, that computer should come pre-loaded with certain information in the form of instance variables.
	    </p>
	    Next we create some methods of the computer - we might want to see which user is currently on the computer, what documents are opened, what programs are being used etc...
	    <pre><code>
	    	class Computer
	    		def Initialize(brand, model, os, user)
	    			@brand = brand
	    			@model = model_number
	    			@os = operating_system
	    			@user = user
	    		end

	    		def current_user
	    			@user
	    		end
	    	end
	    </code></pre>
	    As simple as #current_user is, it will display which user is currently using the computer. Now a pretty neat trick to use instead of just displaying the current user is to use the <code>attr_reader</code>, <code>attr_writer</code> and <code>attr_accessor</code> tools. 
	    	<ul>
	    		<li><code>attr_reader</code> is a reader which means that it just returns a value or state outside of the class, but does not change it. </li>
	    		<li><code>attr_writer</code> is a writer which means that you can change the value of the variable outside of the class, but it is not readable.</li>
	    		<li><code>attr_accessor</code> is both a reader and a writer. It can be used to return and change the value of the variable.</li>
	    	</ul>
	    Therefore, our new code would look like this...
	    <pre><code>
	    	class Computer
	    		attr_reader :user
	    		def Initialize(brand, model, os, user)
	    			@brand = brand
	    			@model = model_number
	    			@os = operating_system
	    			@user = user
	    		end

	    		<!-- def current_user
	    			@user
	    		end -->
	    	end
	    </code></pre>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	    	I hope this gives you a general understand of <code>Classes</code> and how they work with attributes and methods. Please come back soon!

	<p>Growing up, I wasn't one of those kids who knew exactly what he wanted to be (i.e. Astronaut, Police Office, Cowboy etc.), instead I focused on what I love doing which was playing football. It was until I built my first computer from scratch that I knew being in the IT Industry was where I belong. It was the ability to teach myself how to use & create technology that formed my path in life. Hence, I earned a Masters Degree from DeVry in MIS and currently work in the IT field for a Network Consultant.</p>
