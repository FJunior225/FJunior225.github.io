		<h3>FJ Collins Jr. - February 27th, 2016</h3>

		<p>Here we are at Week 9 of my DBC journey through the first phase, Phase-0. It has been an exciting, rewarding, stressful, and discouraging at times, but overall an amazing experience. THe process of building and creating a website from the ground up has been a constant reminder of how I have grown the past two months.</p>
		<p>What I have enjoyed the most about creating a personal website is the ability to open myself up to the world without holding anything back. I have learned so much about myself, not only technically, but emotionally and mentally. It has been a long time since I have constantly wrote/typed anything and it has always been something I enjoy doing when I really get into the zone. I also enjoyed the self-satisfaction of creating something that is my own and molding it into something that represents myself. My website has a lot more growing to do, but the fact that I was able to do this and it reflects past challenges and project, and will reflect future projects couldn't be more satisfying. However, with anything, there are frustrations that occur.</p>
		<p>I have been challenged throughout this entire process and the one thing that took a beating was my patience. The learning process and the ability to replicate what I learned and show it through a website was a constant back and forth to see what changed and if what I changed was correct. I think that mostly has to do with styling the page to how I want it to look and of course what I want it to look like is never the most simplest form, it has to be complicated and intricate :-T. My patience was tested day in and day out to the point where some of my ideas were cut till my skills will be developed a little more. However, with every growing process, there will be growing pains and you must expect that. It's how you let the growing pains affect your capabilities as a coder and even a person.</p>
		<p>The one thing that I must take away from all of this is that it is under my control. I have the ability to add or remove something from my website. I have the control over how my website looks and how it reflects my personal achievements. I must be able to gain the knowledge and resources to make sure the power I have over my website can be used correctly. If I get too frustrated and give up, that is only on myself and not the people or material trying to teach me. I must always have a growth mindset - only I can control what happens.</p>

	<p>Growing up, I wasn't one of those kids who knew exactly what he wanted to be (i.e. Astronaut, Police Office, Cowboy etc.), instead I focused on what I love doing which was playing football. It was until I built my first computer from scratch that I knew being in the IT Industry was where I belong. It was the ability to teach myself how to use & create technology that formed my path in life. Hence, I earned a Masters Degree from DeVry in MIS and currently work in the IT field for a Network Consultant.</p>
