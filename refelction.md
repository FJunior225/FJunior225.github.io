What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I was able to correctly space out my images and headers using padding and margins. I also created and inset border around the middle of my website to section off my blogs and projects together. It was a lot of trial and error getting the correct numbers in place and making the website how I wanted to, but that trial and error taught me about each property.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned a lot about positioning in this exercise because I had text over an image in my header. Therefore, I had do more trial and error with positioning and get the links and headers exactly where I wanted over the image. Hence, I used some relative and absolute positioning in my CSS doc.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The borders were the easiest to implement - it was easy to control what had a border, how thick to make it, what type of style it should have, whereas positioning and margins were harder. I began this exercise before 3.4 pairing session and so I had a hard time understanding the concepts of positioning. After the pairing session, I had less difficulty moving blocks and text around my website, but still more trial and error than borders.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that my CSS document became a long list of elements very quickly. I also learned the importance of classes, IDs, and other structure elements to add during the HTML side of coding. These elements will help the CSS process go more smoothly and allow for less repitition of CSS formatting.
