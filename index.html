			<h2 class="headers">Glance Into My Life</h2>
			<p class="bio">
			Growing up, I wasn't one of those kids who knew exactly what he wanted to be (i.e. Astronaut, Police Office, Cowboy etc.), instead I focused on what I love doing which was playing football. I played football most of my life and when I realized I could not play forever, I was stuck with what to do with my career. It wasn't until I built my first computer from scratch that I knew working with computers was where I belong. It was the ability to teach myself how to use & create technology that formed my path in life. Hence, I earned a Masters Degree from DeVry in Management Information Systems and  began working in the IT field for a Network Consultant for two years. From there I created my own business repairing smartphone and tablet screens in coordination with a company based in CA, iCracked. Now I am on my journey through Dev Bootcamp to become a Software Engineer and fulfill my desire to create and build efficient and readable software programs to better humanity.
